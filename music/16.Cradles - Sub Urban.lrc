[00:12.69]I live inside my own world of make-believe
[00:18.64]Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
[00:24.71]I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
[00:30.79]Cross out the ones who held my cries and watched me weep
[00:36.75]I love everything
[00:39.62]Fire's spreading all around my room
[00:43.22]My world's so bright
[00:44.64]It's hard to breathe, but that's alright
[00:47.48]Hush!
[00:00.00][00:51.18]
[00:59.64]Shh
[00:00.00][01:04.03]
[01:12.58]Tape my eyes open to force reality (oh, no, no)
[01:18.44]Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee?
[01:24.54]I live inside my own world of make-believe
[01:30.69]Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
[01:36.49]Somedays, I feel skinnier than all the other days
[01:42.25]Sometimes, I can't tell if my body belongs to me
[01:48.74]I love everything
[01:51.61]Fire's spreading all around my room
[01:55.33]My world's so bright
[01:56.86]It's hard to breathe, but that's alright
[01:59.75]Hush
[00:00.00][02:02.45]
[02:11.45]Shh
[00:00.00][02:17.59]
[02:24.10]I wanna taste your content
[02:26.86]Hold your breath and feel the tension
[02:29.80]Devils hide behind redemption
[02:32.99]Honesty is a one-way gate to hell
[02:36.27]I wanna taste consumption
[02:38.88]Breathe faster to waste oxygen
[02:41.87]Hear the children sing aloud
[02:44.52]It's music 'til the wick burns out
[02:47.82]Hush
[00:00.00][02:50.22]
[03:00.37]Just wanna be carefree lately, yeah
[03:05.26]Just kicking up daisies
[03:07.94]Got one too many quarters in my pocket
[03:11.56]Count 'em like the four-leaf clovers in my locket
[03:14.81]Untied laces, yeah
[03:18.56]Just tripping on daydreams
[03:21.08]Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
[03:24.96]Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep
[00:00.00][03:26.52]
